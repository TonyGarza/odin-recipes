        Many cultures have put a spin on the empanada. This recipe descends from
        the Argentine way of making these little meat pies. The Argentine
        empanada is small, just two or three delicious bites. The technique to
        master in this recipe is holding the open empanada with one hand and
        using the other hand to crimp the outer edge and for a decorative braid.
        The less dexterous among us should use a fork for this.

        Note: If you are strapped for time you can always use pre-made empanada
        dough. There is a good dough made by Goya. The filling provides for 36
        empanadas.

        <li>1 pound beef chuck diced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper as needed</li>
        <li>lard or olive oil for sauteing</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>2 ounces diced chorizo</li>
        <li>1/2 pounds of peeled and diced potatoes</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves mashed to paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>large pinch of cayenne</li>
        <li>beef or chicken broth as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped scalions</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
        <li>2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make the dough: Put 2 cups boiling water, 4 ounces lard and 1½
          teaspoons salt in large mixing bowl. Stir to melt lard and dissolve
          salt. Cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually stir in flour with a wooden spoon until dough comes
          together. Knead for a minute or two on a floured board, until firm and
          smooth. Add more flour if sticky. Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the filling: Season chopped beef generously with salt and pepper
          and set aside for 10 minutes. Melt 3 tablespoons lard in a wide heavy
          skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and fry until nicely browned,
          stirring throughout to keep pieces separate, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn heat down to medium and add onion and chorizo. Keep turning
          mixture with a spatula, as if cooking hash, until onion is softened
          and browned, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, garlic, thyme and
          marjoram and stir well to incorporate. (Add a little more fat to pan
          if mixture seems dry.) Season again with salt and pepper and let
          mixture fry for 2 more minutes. Stir in tomato paste, pimentón and
          cayenne, then a cup of broth or water. Turn heat to simmer, stirring
          well to incorporate any caramelized bits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook for about 10 more minutes, until both meat and potatoes are
          tender and the sauce just coats them — juicy but not saucy is what you
          want. Taste and adjust seasoning for full flavor (intensity will
          diminish upon cooling). Stir in scallions and cool to room
          temperature, then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide chilled dough into 1-ounce pieces and form into 2-inch diameter
          balls. Roll each piece into a 4½-inch circle. Lay circles on a baking
          sheet lightly dusted with flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Moisten outer edge of each round with water. Put about 2 tablespoons
          filling in the center of each round, adding a little chopped green
          olive and some hard-cooked egg to each. Wrap dough around filling to
          form empanada, pressing edges together. Fold edge back and finish by
          pinching little pleats or crimping with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place empanadas on parchment-lined or oiled
          baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Brush tops lightly with lard or
          butter and bake on top shelf of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
          Serve warm.
